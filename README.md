ABOUT THE SOFTWARE
====================================================
I created this software because I needed to make glyphs for an Arduino project that used the Adafruit GFX library, but didn't feel like figuring out a bunch of hex codes to create them.
In order to use these glyphs on an Arduino, they need to be placed in a font file and included with the sketch code; there should be plenty of information about this process online, especially the Adafruit website/forums. 
I am in no way an experienced programmer, so please don't expect the code to be perfect, free of bugs, etc.
Anyone who has an idea on how to make the software better is encouraged to modify and redistribute it this code, so long as the terms stated above are followed. 
Please send all feedback and requests for features to my email address (nathanstrobl34@gmail.com).

IMPORTANT NOTE
====================================================
A JAR file is included in the 'out' folder for easier execution of the application.
